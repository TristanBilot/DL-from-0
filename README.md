# Deep Learning from Zer0 series

The aim of this series is to implement a Deep Learning framework from scratch while explaining the theory of each part in blog posts <a href="https://tristanbilot.me/#courses">available here</a>.

This framework will be used in the next blogs as a foundation block for the development of more advanced models such as `GNNs`, `VAEs` or `Transformers`.
